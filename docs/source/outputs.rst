Outputs
=======

The |mdss|_ package organizes simulation results into a structured
directory hierarchy. This hierarchy mirrors the simulation setup defined
in the YAML file.

Structure of the Output Directory

File Types
----------

1. **CSV Files**:

   -  Stored in Refinement Level directory
   -  Contain simulation data, including:

      -  Coefficient of Lift (CL)
      -  Coefficient of Drag (CD)
      -  Wall Time

2. **YAML Files**:

   -  Two types:

      -  Per-case YAML files (``aoa_<aoa>.yaml``) stored in each AoA
         directory.
      -  A summary YAML file (``overall_sim_info.yaml``) for the entire
         simulation in the output directory.

3. **PNG Files**:

   -  Comparison plots of experimental vs. simulated data, generated
      using ``gen_case_plots()`` are stored in the corresponding case
      level directory.
   -  Comparison plots generated using ``compare_scenarios()`` are
      stored in the user specified output directory

4. **Miscellaneous**:

   -  Additionally, the following files are stored in the output
      directory:

      -  A copy of the input yaml file.
      -  A python script that will be used for subprocess.
      -  A job script when running on HPC.
      -  Output from the job when running on HPC.

This structure ensures that simulation results are easy to navigate and
analyze.
